# Altheia Protocol – Project Overview

## 🔍 What is Altheia?

- A **decentralized risk and yield rating protocol** for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)
- Provides **standardized, transparent scoring** for assets like real estate, private credit, commodities, and tokenized funds
- Acts as the **“credit rating oracle”** for DeFi and institutional RWA markets

## 🧩 What Problems Does It Solve?

- ❌ No standard way to assess RWA token quality, risk, or yield
- ❌ Trust in issuer documents is opaque and unverifiable
- ❌ Investors lack tools to compare or filter RWA exposure
- ❌ DeFi lending markets don’t know which RWA tokens are trustworthy

## ✅ What Does Altheia Provide?

- 🏗️ **Infrastructure** to submit, validate, and score tokenized assets
- 🧠 A **scoring engine** combining:
  - Validator inputs
  - Chainlink-powered oracles
  - Jurisdictional and historical data
- 📈 **Canonical risk/yield scores** delivered via public feeds and APIs
- 🔎 **Investor dashboard** to explore and compare rated RWAs
- 🧾 **Open API** for DeFi protocols to integrate score feeds (risk gates, APY targeting, etc.)

## 👥 Who Uses It?

- 🏢 **Issuers** – upload tokenized RWAs, submit for scoring
- 🧮 **Validators** – review off-chain documents, stake reputation to provide scores
- 🌐 **Oracles** – fetch government/APY/ownership data via Chainlink Functions
- 📊 **Investors** – browse scored assets and allocate capital with transparency
- 🧠 **Curators** (optional) – create portfolios based on score tiers or risk themes

## 🌍 Why It Matters (Impact)

- Builds **trust** in the on-chain RWA economy
- Unlocks capital for **regulated and institutional DeFi**
- Standardizes a “truth layer” for tokenized real estate, credit, commodities, etc.
- Helps DeFi protocols build **composable risk-aware lending markets**
